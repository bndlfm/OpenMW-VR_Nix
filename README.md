# OpenMW-VR_Nix
Builds and works for me with hyprland, nvidia rtx 3070, NixOS 24.11. Should work on non-nixos systems but you probably have to use [NixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL)

Since I use SteamVR I run it via `steam-run openmw-launcher` or directly after adding it as a non-steam game to my steam library.
